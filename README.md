A download proxy is a type of service that enables you to download a file through a remote server. This means that the remote server initiates the download process and streams the file to your device. It can come in handy if you are on a blocked network or if the file is located far away, as you can utilize a content delivery network (CDN) to enhance the download speed of the file.
